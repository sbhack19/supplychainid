# Ethereum

## Why Ethereum

We chose to use the Ethereum protocol for our blockchain software because it is very mature and widely used. This will allow our implementation to be interoperable with the most number of other systems immediately.

## Installing Ethereum (Advanced)

The Ethereum server client we are using is [Parity](https://wiki.parity.io/Setup), a version of the protocol compatible with Core, and additional features.
