      <h3 class="mt-5">Overview</h3>
      <p>
        The goal is to create a solution to the logistical problem of the traceability and authentication of unique products. To achieve this we focused on a short and practical approach, after contemplating
        the feasibility of putting the Gs1 standard into the form of multiple smart contracts, which could be updated on e.g handovers. Skipping options that were to big to tackle in the short period of 
        the hackathon we agreed on enshuring traceability by just pushing the standard in form of JSON directly to the chain. This approach might be most useful in a consortium chain where the participants are 
        selected to prevent unwanted modification.

          <p>
            In leiu of, and in preparation for, Ethereum being available on AWS Managed Blockchain, we have recreated the results of the simple one-click deploy.
          </p>

          <h4>Blockchain</h4>

          <p>
            Our solution is a private Ethereum instance <a href="https://www.parity.io/" target="_blank">Parity</a> running on EC2 inside of a VPC. The Security Group rules of the VPC allow for communication only on the WebSockets RPC port between the Ethereum instance and Elastic Beanstalk. This is done via the official <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/" target="_blank">web3 SDK</a>.
          </p>

          <h4>API</h4>

          <p>
            The auto scaling Elastic Beanstalk setup uses the Node.js stack and serves the REST API endpoints, the static resources for the web/mobile application, and a pseudo-realtime feed of data on the blockchain.
          </p>

          <h4>Ingestion Proxy</h4>

          <p>
            The API handles ingestion of the GS1 event data, writing it to the blockchain as a transaction data payload. A future version could instead convert the raw data to a <strong>"GS1 Smart Contract"</strong> deployment, opening the possibility for more 'active' data model objects.
          </p>

          <h4>Future</h4>

          <p>
            We confirmed with the AWS team that our configuration can be written as a Cloud Formation yaml file for easier automated deployments
          </p>
